# tiva_mcp
basic scheduler for Tiva-C

NOTE TO SELF: the ./tiva_mcp directory is the .git directory for this project,
but I have been using a local working directory (tiva_xenu_scheduler) when
editing and adding files. The local working directory will occasionally be
synced with the .git directory to be backed up. The idea is to maintain the .git
repo as a safe, stable backup point, while the working directory can be a bit
more chaotic. This prevents the repository from getting messed up with chaotic
changes in times of frustration.

This set-up also makes sure that code that gets into the repository has been
vetted, tested, or otherwise confirmed to not be a total mess
